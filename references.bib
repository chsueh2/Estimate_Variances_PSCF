@article{osti_977428,
title = {Monte Carlo parameter studies and uncertainty analyses with MCNP5},
author = {Brown, F B and Sweezy, J E and Hayes, R B},
abstractNote = {A software tool called mcnp-pstudy has been developed to automate the setup, execution, and collection of results from a series of MCNPS Monte Carlo calculations. This tool provides a convenient means of performing parameter studies, total uncertainty analyses, parallel job execution on clusters, stochastic geometry modeling, and other types of calculations where a series of MCNPS jobs must be performed with varying problem input specifications. Monte Carlo codes are being used for a wide variety of applications today due to their accurate physical modeling and the speed of today's computers. In most applications for design work, experiment analysis, and benchmark calculations, it is common to run many calculations, not just one, to examine the effects of design tolerances, experimental uncertainties, or variations in modeling features. We have developed a software tool for use with MCNP5 to automate this process. The tool, mcnp-pstudy, is used to automate the operations of preparing a series of MCNP5 input files, running the calculations, and collecting the results. Using this tool, parameter studies, total uncertainty analyses, or repeated (possibly parallel) calculations with MCNP5 can be performed easily. Essentially no extra user setup time is required beyond that of preparing a single MCNP5 input file.},
